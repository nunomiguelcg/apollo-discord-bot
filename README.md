Hello this is Apollo! I am a discord bot. Feel free to add me to your server.

Dont know how to do that? No problem.

If you want to run the bot locally (on your computer):
1. Create a bot on discord developer portal: https://discord.com/developers
Here are some resources to help get you started: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html
2. Download the files.
3. Unzip the files on your prefered location.
4. Open the folder and create a text file.
5. Open the file and type: TOKEN = ""
6. Inside of the "" paste your bot's token. You can get the token from the discord developers portal.
7. Download and install node js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
8. Open the terminal and select the directory where you have the bot's files. (Use cd to navigate into the folder. Example: cd desktop/apollo-discord-bot)
9. Run the bot. Just type node index.js
10. You are all set up. You should see your bot online now. Enjoy!

Now you xcan play around with commands.

Here is a list of the available commands:
-ping 
(The bot will answer with pong!)
-youtube
(The bot will send you a youtube link. Tip: You can change the youtube link. Go to the bot's folder and open commands folder. Open the file "youtube.js" in a text editor and replace the youtube link with your channel's youtube link, for example. Restart the bot and you're ready to go!)
